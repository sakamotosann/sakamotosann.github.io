I will let you know how foolish you are later.” feng5166 says.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“The second problem is, given an positive integer N, we define an equation like this:<br>  N=a[1]+a[2]+a[3]+…+a[m];<br>  a[i]&gt;0,1&lt;=m&lt;=N;<br>My question is how many different equations you can find for a given N.<br>For example, assume N is 4, we can find:<br>  4 = 4;<br>  4 = 3 + 1;<br>  4 = 2 + 2;<br>  4 = 2 + 1 + 1;<br>  4 = 1 + 1 + 1 + 1;<br>so the result is 5 when N is 4. Note that “4 = 3 + 1” and “4 = 1 + 3” is the same in this problem. Now, you do it!”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>###Input<br>The input contains several test cases. Each test case contains a positive integer N(1&lt;=N&lt;=120) which is mentioned above. The input is terminated by the end of file.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>###Output<br>For each test case, you have to output a line contains an integer P which indicate the different equations you have found.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>###Sample Input<br>4<br>10<br>20</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>###Sample Output<br>5<br>42<br>627</p></blockquote>]]></content>
